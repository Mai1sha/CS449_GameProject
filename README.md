# CS449_GameProject
This is a project to build a SOS game. It can be played in one of the two modes, simple mode & general mode. I will be using java as proframming language and Junit for unit testing,
Java swing for GUI. I am new to unit testing with very little knowledge and practice of java & GUI.
